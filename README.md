# ClipboardIncrementer

ClipboardNumberIncrementer is a Python script designed to enhance efficiency in tasks that involve incrementing numbers copied from predefined patterns. By automatically detecting and incrementing the last number in the clipboard content upon each trigger event, it simplifies data entry processes and reduces manual errors.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Number Incrementing:** Automatically detects the last number in the clipboard content and increments it upon each trigger event, providing seamless copying of incremented numbers.
- **Visual Confirmation:** Provides a visual indicator of the incremented number in the clipboard, ensuring users can verify the copied data.
- **Streamlined Workflow:** Optimizes repetitive tasks involving number increments by combining visual cues with automatic clipboard management.
- **User-friendly Design:** Features a user-centric design with clear instructions and error prevention mechanisms to enhance user experience.

## Usage Guide

1. Launch the script by executing `python ClipboardNumberIncrementer.py` in your command line or terminal.
2. The script will listen for trigger events and automatically increment the last number in the clipboard content when triggered.
3. Press the designated trigger key to initiate the incrementing process and copy the incremented number to the clipboard.

## Customization

Customize the script according to your specific requirements by adjusting the trigger key or modifying the incrementing logic within the script.

## Trigger Event

Pressing the `V` key triggers the script to increment the last number in the clipboard content by 1. As a result, when pasting with `Ctrl+V`, the incremented number will be pasted.
